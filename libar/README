INTRODUCTION
============

This is the development area for Sendmail's libar, which is a reusable
(i.e. not tied to any particular package) asynchronous resolver.


NOTES
=====

o Uses pthreads, and thus may not be compatible with applications using
  other threading systems (state threads, event threads).

o NOTE: There may be security issues here. Since this was written several
  resolver security issues have been fixed and those may need to be fixed
  here as well. And I've noted that this code leaves a UDP port wide open
  and it may be possible for malious software to inject false responces
  to make this code report incorrect results.
